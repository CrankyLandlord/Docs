## LittleBigPlanet PSVita Discord
The unofficial official Discord for LBP Vita. Genuinely the worst server in existence, so I highly recommend it.

## Imagisphere
A community centered around reverse engineering, modding, and preserving development history around LittleBigPlanet.

## EggShapes
A modding community centered around Sound Shapes, a half-rhythm game for PS3/PS4/PSVita similar to Geometry Dash. They've done lots of cool things with the game, including level viewers, custom servers, and more.

## LittleBigPlanet's Hard Level Community
A server focused around movement tech and creating hard levels. They have a 'tier' system for players and a whole suite of levels to grind, so if you're up for a challenge, here's the place.
